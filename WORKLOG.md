## Decisions Made
| Decision | Date | Context |
|----------|------|---------|
| Grouped parentheticals over monolithic strings | 2026-01-24 | Better composability - users can copy individual concept clusters |
| Remove group labels from UI | 2026-01-24 | Terms are self-documenting, labels added clutter |
| Remove lightning bolt from Recent | 2026-01-24 | Simplify visual hierarchy |
| Use Opus 4.5 with prompt caching | 2026-01-24 | Quality + speed for generation |
| Email-based favorites (not localStorage UUID) | 2026-01-24 | Works across devices |
| Specificity levels collapsed by default | 2026-01-24 | Reduce visual noise, expand on demand |
